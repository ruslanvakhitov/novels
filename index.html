            </h2>
<div data-v-5fc3cba6="" class="read-content fontSize20" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px;"><p></p><p></p>"Here!!"<p></p><p></p><p>Claire said out loud as she hurriedly tried to put on her earrings while the cab stopped in front of her parents villa. She picked up her coat and quickly shrugged it on, it was quite a chilly morning.</p><p></p><p>"Here? Oh Oh! You live here?"</p><p></p><p>He asked as he looked back and Claire shrugged.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately."</p><p></p><p>She glanced at the huge monstrosity that was their family home and smiled, she did miss it.</p><p></p><p>She groaned as she dragged her purse with her immediately the cab came to a staggering halt in front of the pretty wrought iron gate.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you so so much! You are a lifesaver!"</p><p></p><p>She muttered as she handed a couple of hundred dollar bills to the driver as he came out of the car to help her with her luggage.</p><p></p><p>She was late, very late. She could only imagine what her mother and her father would be scolding her about the moment she walked in.</p><p></p><p>How could you be late to your own sister's wedding! Why didn't you arrive a week ago like we told you to, even when we paid first class for your flight back home to San Diego?</p><p></p><p>And her perfect sister Charlotte would be there trying to calm them down while she convinces them that Claire must have been busy with work or something important, which would be a slight mockery to Claire considering the fact that she was currently unemployed like she had been for the past few months.</p><p></p><p>"Have a nice day! Thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Her driver said as he waved at her while she walked towards the house.</p><p></p><p>The Butler, Grayson was already in front of the house waiting for her, so he called someone to help her with her bags as she walked inside.</p><p></p><p>"Grayson! How are you this fine morning?"</p><p></p><p>She asked and he smiled as she gave him a brief hug.</p><p></p><p>"Very well Ms Claire. Your mother would be delighted to see that you have made it on time."</p><p></p><p>"I know right! That would be after she chastises me for not coming a week ago like she had begged me to."</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure she wouldn't worry too much about that."</p><p></p><p>"And where can I find my sister the bride to be?"</p><p></p><p>She said as they walked past the foyer.</p><p></p><p>Greyson pointed to the stairs.</p><p></p><p>"I believe she should be in her room, although she should be awake by now."</p><p></p><p>Claire looked up at the stairs, that was precisely the same time when their housekeeper Lily rushed down the stairs, she barely noticed Claire's presence.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Charlotte? She isn't in her room and the stylists would be here in half an hour!"</p><p></p><p>She exclaimed. She turned to Claire, surprised to see her and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Claire! You're here already? My God! What did you do to your hair!"</p><p></p><p>She exclaimed as she came down the stairs.</p><p></p><p>Claire smiled as she ran her hands through her hair, it used to be waist length but she had chopped half the hair and it was now shoulder length, easier to manage for her.</p><p></p><p>She grinned at Lily.</p><p></p><p>"I like it! Do you?"</p><p></p><p>She asked as she hugged Lily who was panting after running down the stairs.</p><p></p><p>"It's too early for you to be running around Lily, why are you looking for Charlotte?"</p><p></p><p>Lily smiled.</p><p></p><p>"She has about five hours to get ready and hair and makeup arrives soon. It's even unlike her to be asleep by this time, I checked her room and it doesn't seem like she slept in."</p><p></p><p>Claire cocked her head to the side.</p><p></p><p>"That's strange indeed. But I'm sure everything is fine."</p><p></p><p>"Knowing Charlotte she has probably gone out for a jog or something and doesn't want to bother anyone. I have to go upstairs now."</p><p></p><p>Lily nodded as she touched her forehead. She was tired from her long flight, she wanted to rest.</p><p></p><p>"You are probably right."</p><p></p><p>Her room looked different, of course it was. Her mother must have made sure of that. And she had not been home since the holidays so she understood why. Her posters were removed and the d√©cor had been changed. It went from being a dark room with posters of famous artists and LED lights to a light and airy room with a four poster bed and flowery wallpaper.</p><p></p><p>Predictable.</p><p></p><p>It reminded her more of Charlotte's room.</p><p></p><p>Claire Reagan Branson was the daughter of Edward Branson and Lauren Wellington-Branson, she was a twin, her twin sister, Charlotte Rhea Branson.</p><p></p><p>Even though they were identical twins, they had grown up more apart than ever. Their entire childhood, the memories Claire remembered were filled with them fighting over one thing or the other while screaming at each other.</p><p></p><p>As adults, they grew farther apart. With Charlotte being the perfect sister while Claire was more of the rebel sister. Charlotte easily became her parents' favourite.</p><p></p><p>She did everything that was asked of her, unlike Claire who rebelled against every of her parents' decision concerning her life.</p><p></p><p>She jumped on her bed with child-like glee and proceeded to rest a while before confronting her parents, at least she can count on them being too occupied to even notice that she was in the house.</p><p></p><p>Their favorite daughter was getting married today, they would be ecstatic.</p><p></p><p>A loud noise woke up Claire. Someone had slammed her door really hard and she looked up from her bed frowning, to meet her mother in front of her with her prodding grey eyes staring at her daughter's.</p><p></p><p>She had her arms folded and she was tapping her left foot in that usual manner that meant she was irritated. She was still in her dressing robe and her hair was unbound so Claire could tell that she had just woken up.</p><p></p><p>"When did you get here?'</p><p></p><p>She asked and Claire picked up her phone and looked at the time.</p><p></p><p>"About an hour and a half ago. What's the problem?"</p><p></p><p>"Your sister is missing. That is the problem."</p><p></p><p>"Missing?"</p><p></p><p>Claire sat upright.</p><p></p><p>"That can't be right. Have you checked her room?"</p><p></p><p>Her mother gave her a look.</p><p></p><p>"Very funny. I have. We have looked everywhere."</p><p></p><p>"I've called her phone, the line's dead, I've called Henry and he hasn't heard from her since yesterday too."</p><p></p><p>"Calm down Mum. She probably just went out for a jog or something."</p><p></p><p>"On her wedding day?!"</p><p></p><p>Her mother snapped as she glared at her.</p><p></p><p>Claire jumped out of her bed. The only way her mother would stop disturbing her sleep was if she at least helped to find Charlotte. Although she didn't think it was that much of a problem, Charlotte was the perfect sister, she would never be so irresponsible.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>Her mother asked as Claire slipped on her shoes.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just check her room and call some of her friends."</p><p></p><p>Her mum sighed as she followed her out of the room and into the large hallway.</p><p></p><p>"I called all of them! No use! They're all awake and getting ready by the way. Mia her maid of honor would be here any minute now."</p><p></p><p>So Mia was her maid of honor, Claire clicked her tongue.</p><p></p><p>Claire disliked Mia. It was a strong dislike and for good reason too. Mia and Charlotte have been friends since college and for some reason, Mia liked to act like she was Charlotte's twin.</p><p></p><p>She found fault in every single thing Claire did and would literally throw Claire under the bus as long as she got to kiss Charlotte's ass. She was one of the reasons Charlotte and Claire didn't have such a good relationship. Because stupid Mia kept coming in the middle of everything.</p><p></p><p>"See! She's not in the room like I said!"</p><p></p><p>Her mother said as Claire walked in.</p><p></p>Something seemed off, Claire noticed as she walked into the room.<p></p><p></p><p>Charlotte's wedding gown was hanging in the corner with her shoes and everything, there was a mini set up at the side where the stylists were going to fix her hair and makeup and the room looked exactly as she remembered it except that she could tell something was off.</p><p></p><p>"Her laptop's not here Mum."</p><p></p><p>Claire said as she checked the top of her bedside drawer. Charlotte was addicted to work, her laptop was always on her bedside drawer.</p><p></p><p>She opened the drawers to find them mostly empty, unless they had been cleared out earlier, Claire knew they were never empty, they usually contained her pills, some lip balm and Charlotte's endless supply of midnight snacks.</p><p></p><p>With her panic rising and her mother catching up quickly, Claire ran to the walk in closet hoping what she was thinking wasn't true. Everything looked intact but upon closer inspection, a lot of things were gone.</p><p></p><p>A pair of shoes there missing from the rack, some of her scarves, jeans, random stuff seemed to be missing. Especially one of her favourite suitcase.</p><p></p><p>"Mum! How could you have missed this!"</p><p></p><p>Claire said as she looked around the closet.</p><p></p><p>"Charlotte's gone!"</p><p></p><p>"No! No! That's not possible! Maybe something happened to her..."</p><p></p><p>Claire shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Well, have Grayson pull up the CCTV camera footage while I look around more."</p><p></p><p>Her mother walked towards her bed and sat on it, confused and worried.</p><p></p><p>Several thoughts were going through her head.</p><p></p><p>Her daughter couldn't just have run away, no! That wasn't the kind of person Charlotte was.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the pillows again and tried to rearrange them and found a note under one of them.</p><p></p><p>"There's a note here."</p><p></p><p>She said with a&nbsp; shaky voice.</p><p></p><p>"What does it say?"</p><p></p><p>Claire asked as she approached her mother whose hands had began to shake uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Charlotte's left the country!"</p><p></p></div>

Chapter 2

<div data-v-5fc3cba6="" class="read-content fontSize20" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px;"><p dir="ltr">"How is that even possible!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her mother said as she dropped the note.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"This can't be my Char! Why would she do such a thing??"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire snatched the note from her mother while her mother stormed out of the room.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><em>"Mum, Dad, if you're reading this, I've left the country. I don't want to marry Henry, I'm sorry it took me this long to realise it. I love Rhys and we're going to try and start a family here. I promise to be in touch when you have both cooled off."</em></p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><em>Love Char. </em></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Wow!</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire thought as she stared at the note in disbelief. Who would have ever thought? That the perfect Charlotte Branson would elope? And with none other than her parent's Chauffeur.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire couldn't hold in her laughter anymore, oh it was hilarious!</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The humiliation her parents would face after throwing such a huge ass wedding only for her sister not to show up!</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her father would be furious.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of the devil, her father stormed in and snatched the note from her hands, not even caring for his other daughter's presence.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Let me see that! Let me see that for myself!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He shouted as he read through it angrily.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He squeezed the note after a few seconds.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Grayson!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He called for the butler who was already next to him.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Yes sir. Pull up the footage from last night till this morning. I want to know what exactly happened."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He said as he stormed out again.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire rolled her eyes.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Hello to you too Dad."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">She muttered as she walked out of the room.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">She was hungry, she thought as her stomachs growled. Everyone was apparently too worried sick to eat anything but not her.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">She walked into the kitchen and found a feast. The chef had been working on breakfast all morning, before even knowing what was going on.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Their cousins, Charlotte's bridesmaids and countless others would be coming to their house very early to see the bride and start to leave for the church, but there was no bride.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Not a bride in sight.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Oooh! What are these? They look divine!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire exclaimed as she rubbed her hands with glee.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Red velvet waffles with a cream cheese glaze Ms Claire."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Oh I'd taste that."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire said as she picked up a plate.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"It's good to see you again Ms Claire."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He said and Claire nodded, mouth full of waffles.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Good to be back."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">She said after she swallowed, this was the exact same time Mia walked in.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"I somehow knew I'd find you here."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">She said as she scoffed.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire rolled her eyes, it was Mia. She turned as she titled her head to the side, smiling mischievously, she wouldn't mind poking Mia a little.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Tell me Mia, how is it that you claim to be my sister's best friend and yet she didn't tell you she was going to run away?"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire asks and Mia's frown deepened.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">She seemed to be half ready for the wedding already. With her hair in an elaborate twist of curls, her makeup done and what seemed to be her dress in a hanger.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"I had no idea. I'm sure she didn't tell me because I would have convinced her otherwise."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Oh I'm sure you would."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire scoffed.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Shouldn't you be upstairs consoling your parents?"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire sighed.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"I just got back from a long trip, what I need is sleep."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Sleep? How can you sleep peacefully knowing your sister has eloped and the wedding is today?"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"If my sister thinks running away is what's best for her, I support her fully. There's nothing we can do but cancel the wedding."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Mia raised her eyebrow.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Cancel the wedding of the year? Just like that?!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire shrugged.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"They have no other choice do they?"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">She said as she walked out of the room. It was sad, her parents would be devastated and luckily for her they would be too busy crying about it to pry into her own life and the very thought of that gave her relief.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Much relief.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">She walked into the living room to find even more people.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her younger brother Nicholas was seated between his parents while talking to their Dad.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He was a younger version of their father and even though he was just three years younger than Charlotte and Claire, he liked to act like he was older. Their mother coddled him, being her only son, there was rarely anything that she denied him. </p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her uncle and aunt and two of her cousins were also there, all equally clueless on the next line of action.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Claire?"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her uncle asked and Claire nodded her head.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Hello Uncle Richard. Aunt May."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">She said as she waved a little.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her Uncle smiled a little, he looked worried, they all were.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"I still find it a bit recognising the two of you. I thought I got the hang of it before, but clearly not."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her mother's ears perked up at that.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"That's it!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"What is it?"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her father said as he turned to look at her mother, everyone else did to.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her mother turned to her, her piercing grey eyes on Claire.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire felt uncomfortable underneath her gaze, shifting a bit.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"You will take your sister's place."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her mother said.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Nobody expected the deafening silence that followed, or the laughter that erupted from Claire's mouth.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Everyone else didn't seem to find it funny.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Mum! That's a really good one."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"I don't think she's joking Claire."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her brother Nick said and Claire shrugged</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"You have to be joking Mum! That's not an option. Charlotte was the one who's supposed to marry Henry whatever his name is. Not me."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"You can't just make me take her place like that. It's not easy."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"It is as a matter of fact very easy. The two of you are identical. No one would notice or even care as long as the wedding's still on. You would be acting in place of your sister. Everyone else would think you are her, except that won't be the truth."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire shook her head, the seriousness in her mother's face was scary.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"No! No!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"I'm afraid your mother is right Claire."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her father said grimly as he stood up.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"We cannot cancel the wedding, I have talked to Henry's parents and they don't want it cancelled either."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Think of how much humiliation and disgrace you'd be saving your family from."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"At the expense of what? At the expense of my life! Can you just hear yourself speak for a second! Is everyone here actually agreeing to this?"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">As Claire looked around in disbelief, everyone looked as if they were silently agreeing.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Everyone.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">They were all mad!</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire thought as she shook her head.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her Aunt May moved closer.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"I know this is hard Claire, but this is a sacrifice you must make. The Laurents have been our friends and your father's business partners for years! This is supposed to be the societal wedding of the year! Millions have been spent on this wedding already! We cannot just cancel!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"I am sorry Claire. Henry is a good man. The Laurents are also good people too. If you don't do this, our family name would be dragged in the mud."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her father added solemnly.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire scoffed.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">As if she gave two fucks about the 'family name'</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"I don't care! This is my life and you can't just wake up and decide to switch it up! I don't want to get married!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"You have no choice Claire. I'm sorry about that but we must do what we have to do. Please, I beg of you, at least go through the wedding first and then you can be free to do whatever you want after a few months."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her mother pleaded and Claire raised her eyebrows. Now they were trying to bribe her.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"That's not the tempting offer you think it is Mum. I know you too well..."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">A phone vibrates and her father looks at it and sighs.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"It's the Laurents again. I'll tell them to proceed with the church and that you're taking your sister's place."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire's jaw dropped.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"What! I never agreed to any of that!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her father shrugged as he starts walking out of the room.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"We're having a wedding today no matter what you say Claire!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"You're getting married today! It is your duty to your family! You must!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire's mother said as she held her wrist tightly, Claire tried to wiggle away but her mother's grip was surprisingly strong.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Married?! You must be joking mother! I'd rather fall off a cliff!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Everyone is waiting Claire, you have no choice!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her mother snapped at her and Claire snatched her hand away from hers in annoyance.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Why must I be forced to suffer for Charlotte's mistakes?!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Because she'd do the same for you."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her mother seethed. There was heavy silence in the room</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Charlotte would do the same for you and you know it!"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">That was it, that was why Charlotte would always be the better sister. To her, to everybody else and especially their parents.</p></div>

Chapter 3

<div data-v-5fc3cba6="" class="read-content fontSize20" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px;"><p>Claire was quiet.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>As her hair stylist pulled and plucked and dragged her hair, not the smallest wince came out of her.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She didn't react, not that any of her antics would help her out of her current predicament.<p></p>Unlike Charlotte, Claire did not have the privilege of running away, she still heavily depended on her parents for money and she was aware of how fast she would be caught off if she tried something similar. Charlotte on the other hand, despite her note was more smarter than that, Claire could wager that she had been planning to run away for months and saved up for such emergencies.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Everyone went about their business like nothing happened. Like her sister had not eloped and she wasn't the one who was supposed to be getting married.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Even her mother went back to her energetic bubbly self, like she had not been freaking out just an hour ago. Everyone was rushing to get dressed as Claire was fitted into Charlotte's dress, which seemed to be about two sizes small judging on how tight it was.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>And heavy!!!<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Oh Good Lords it was heavy!<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Charlotte had gone for a full ballgown with a fitting bodice. Claire felt like she was going to pass out as they tightened the ropes of the dress.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Oh it was torture! Every bit of it.<p></p>For some reason, Mia seemed to be unhappy about the change of plans and was fuming in the background.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She was not happy.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Get in line!<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Claire thought.<p></p>She also wasn't happy.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Who wanted to be forced into marriage? She was barely home for six hours and she was already getting fitted into a dress for her sister's wedding day.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Her father was calling to make some slight changes, while her mother was obsessing over every single detail as always.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Nobody seemed to care that Charlotte was in some far away country with the chauffeur probably wondering if her parents had the galls to call off the wedding while sipping pina colada at a beach.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She was curious to know her sister's reaction. Would she feel guilty? For passing her burden to her? Or relieved that she didn't have to face the consequences of her actions if the wedding had been cancelled.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Would she feel sorry and call Claire? Oh Claire definitely knew what was going to happen if Charlotte even dared to speak to her after the wedding, she knew the words she was going to say and she knew exactly how to make Charlotte regret running away.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>" I can't breathe." Claire said as she gritted her teeth while the stylist fixed a crown on her head, she had added extensions to make Claire's hair look longer since the original style that she had in mind was much suited for long hair.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"I've done the best I could do. You're lucky you could even fit in the dress."<p></p>Claire sighed as she touched her cinched waist, she was afraid she was going to pass out from faintness.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"I think I'm going to pass out. It's so tight! And heavy!"<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"You'll only wear it for a few hours, the church and a few pictures and then you'd get into your reception dress."Her mother said as she walked in and cooed.<p></p>"Oh! Darling, you look perfect, even better than I imagined!"<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She said as she gently touched her arm. Claire flinched from her touch and moved away from her.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Her mother had also changed, donning a regal champagne gold dress with elegant beadings along the hem and the neckline of the dress, there was a fur shawl over her shoulders and she seemed to have a proud smile on her face as she admired her daughter.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Charlotte might have been the perfect sister, but during that moment, Claire was nothing short of perfect! The hair, the dress, her face and the way the makeup subtly but confidently brought out all her best features.<p></p><p></p><p>Claire looked breathtaking.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Claire turned to the mirror herself to see what the fuss was about after her veil had been fixed and she was surprised to see hersef. Shocked even! She let out a small gasp. She had never envisioned herself in a wedding dress, and even if she were to pick one, she would have never gone for a ballgown. It would have been on her list of wedding gowns to steer clear off if she ever considered being a bride because she thought it looked too poofy, and that was what she had always thought until she stood in front of the mirror in awe.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Maybe because the dress was about a size smaller it fitted Claire perfectly, the top part pf the dress seemed to fit her like a glove. Her hair was flawless and her veil was the logest veil that she had seen in a while, it was going to take some time to get used to it. Her makeup was subtle but beautiful, dark shadows in her eyeshadows accentuated her grey eyes while the highlighter brought out her full cheekbones.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"We have to work faster, everyone is already at the church. Is she ready?"<p></p>Her mother asked after receiving a call from the Laurents. The stylist looked unsure but nodded her head.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"All done."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She said as she still continued to fuss over Claire's hair.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Claire felt heavy, the dress was a full ivory lace ballgown with a nude lining and lace applique for the sleeves, it was a breathtaking dress, perfect except for the fact that it was a very heavy dress to wear. The skirt was full and the bottom of the dress had heavy beading and lace appliques. Claire was not used to it.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>The next one hour, she did everything that she was told to do, she walked as gracefully as she could muster down the stairs for pictures and made her way to the car. Her bridesmaids were ready, Claire wasn't really familaiar with majority of them, they were all Char's friends and they didn't hide their pity as they watched Claire walk to the car.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>At some point her mother handed her a bouquet and her father came to gush about how beautiful she looked and she barely replied to him.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>It was all really happening, she was getting married.<p></p></div>

Chapter 4

<div data-v-5fc3cba6="" class="read-content fontSize20" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px;"><p>What a wonderful day it was for an outdoor wedding: warm, but not terribly so, unfortunately the wedding was going to take place indoors. The early May sun peeked out occasionally. A pleasant breeze from the north rustled in the surrounding shrubs and Claire took a sneak peek at the chuch where she was to be married. It was large, intimidating, she thought as she imagined Henry Laurent already waiting for her, just like friends and family alike were already waiting for her.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Her father was next to her, he had ridden with her while her maid of honor had preferred to ride with the other bridesmaids. Throughout the entire trip he had been on one phone call or the other, making calls to the press, dictating orders and even talking to the Priest who was to officiate the ceremony.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"It's time for us to go in Claire."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>He said as someone opened her side of the car. One of her stylist was still with her, to make sure that everything went on as planned. She quickly hurried and helped Claire out of the car, hurriedly working to fix her makeup and her veil.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Do you feel comfortable?"<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She asked and Claire sighed.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Is that a trick question?"<p></p>Claire asked as she raised her eyebrows and the stylist chuckled.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"You look breathtaking, you should feel every bit as spectacular as you look, regardless of the circumstances."<p></p>The stylist whispered and Claire smiled, she was right about that, Claire thought as she raised her head higher.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Her father came to her side.<p></p>"Are you ready my dear?"<p></p>He asked gently as he placed a kiss on her forrhead. Despite the sweet gesture, Claire was still angry at him.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"I suppose I have no other choice other than to be ready."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>He nodded and set down her veil for her. They were going to go into the church together, she was going to see the face of the man who was to be her husband. She had a vague memory of how he looked. Tall, snobby looking blond man with a rich accent, Claire was confident she would hate him on first sight.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>The doors of the church slowly opened and Claire saw how perfect everything was. The smell of freshly cut flowers filled the air as she walked in.<p></p>The music stopped, and all heads turned to face the far end of the walk. The opening to the bridal chorus started to play. Down the isle Claire came. There awaiting her was the Priest and her husband to be.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Henry Laurent was stunning. He wore a black, single-breasted, satin tuxedo with a white-wing collar shirt. He was handsome, he looked like a young Justin Hartley with baby blue eyes. His face was emotionless, Claire doubted that he was even looking at her, he had such an expressionless face, she wondered what was going through his mind.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>At the end of the aisle, her father handed her to him, while he held her hand gently and they turned to the podium.<p></p>The music faded, and the Priest stepped up to the microphone, Bible in hand. He smiled at the assembly.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Cherished family members and honored guests, I would like to thank each of you for coming out this morning," he said.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Let us begin by offering thanks to the Lord on this wonderful day."<p></p>They all bowed our heads and he prayed.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>After the prayer was over, the preacher led Claire and Henry through their vows. It was now time for the exchange of rings. An adorable little boy dressed in a blue tuxedo that Claire had no idea who he was walked up and handed Henry a ring. He slipped it on Claire's finger. The pastor smiled and turned to Claire. He repeated the question and received the same monotone reply. Claire took his ring from a small girl dressed in pink and place it on his finger.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"By the power vested unto me I now proclaim you husband and wife." "You may now kiss your bride."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Claire gulped hard and fast, kissing a complete and a total stranger, sure, that would be nice. Henry didn't look phased, he moved closer to her, his eyes avoiding hers as he placed a gentle but very chaste kiss on her lips. It could barely be described as a kiss, but the applause that followed was loud and boisterous enough to suggest that the crowd definitely thought it was enough.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Claire and Henry left the church and in hand, a small fake smile on her face to appease her parents, quickly, they were ushered in the car where Claire sighed as she looked outside. The Laurents and her parents looked ecstatic, disaster evaded, they looked very proud of themselves.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Claire turned to her new husband Henry, he looked like he was determined to be quiet for the rest of the trip, Claire didn't mind but she wanted to at least know who she would be spending the rest of the few months with.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Are you planning on keeping quiet during the entire trip to the reception or what?"<p></p>He turned to her and looked at her, really looked at her.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"I... I'm still in shock."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"I'm also in shock, I mean, you're not the one who was forced to get married right after coming back from a twelve hour trip."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Henry turned to look at her.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"You had no idea that she was leaving?"<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>He asked and Claire shrugged.<p></p>"I haven't talked to my sister in weeks nor seen her in months, we're not exactly close so I doubt she'd have revealed such information to me in the first place."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>There was another long prolonged silence and Claire sighed, she wondered what her sister was doing at the moment, if she had learnt of the wedding and was regretting her actions or if she didn't care.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Why did you decide to take her place?"<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Decide? Bold of you to assume that I had a choice."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Henry scoffed.<p></p>"There is always a choice and it looked like you picked the one you wanted."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Wanted?"<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Claire chuckled.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>The nerve of him to think that she wanted to spend her whole life being tied to him, to be admired as nothing more but a trophy wife and relegated to a life in Rancho Santa Fe doing nothing but being a rich housewife.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She turned to him and pinned him down with a glare, she hated the arrangement just as much as he did and he shouldn't blame her for doing what she had to do to survive.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"If you're so determined to paint me the villain of this whole story then so be it, I don't give two fucks about you or whatever the hell you think about me."<p></p></div>

<div data-v-5fc3cba6="" class="read-content fontSize20" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px;"><p></p><p>The reception turned out to be an even bigger deal than Claire had anticipated, she counted about over a thousand guests seated in the large hall. Henry had decided not to speak with her anymore, unless he had no choice but to speak with her.</p><p></p>&nbsp;Claire didn't care much for him. If he thought that she was the reason for their current predicament then he was truly stupid, of all the people to blame, he had to blame her.&nbsp;<p></p><p></p><p>How much more foolish and insensitive could he be? She thought as she shook her head after glancing at him.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"I'm so glad everything worked out as planned."</p><p></p><p>Her mother whispered in her ear at the reception and Claire rolled her eyes.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Everything didn't work out as planned, she wasn't the one who was supposed to be getting married, Charlotte is! She wanted to scream it out to her mother but then decided to hold her tongue.</p><p></p><p>She had been quiet and obedient all this while, she had no reason to lash out after going through the wedding. The wedding vows had been recited, the deed was done, she was legally married.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"You Father has a surprise for you, I'm sure you'd love it very much."</p><p></p><p>"A surprise?"</p><p></p><p>She asked in bewilderment and her mother nodded her head.</p><p></p><p>"He got it for you last minute, he knows all this hasn't been easy on you, think of this as his own way of saying thank you."</p><p></p><p>Claire nodded.</p><p></p><p>'"Okay."</p><p></p><p>She would have to see the surprise first before she decided on forgiving anyone.</p><p></p><p>Wedding, wedding receptions, Claire found out how little she cared for them and how long it had been since she had been to a wedding, it seemed to her, &nbsp;everyone was mandated to give a speech. Henry's father, Christopher Laurent had given a long lengthy speech, praising his new daughter in law Claire like he knew her personally. Of course most of the things he used to describe her were characteristics that could only be attributed to Charlotte but no one really seemed to care.</p><p></p><p>Just how majority of the people seemed to brush over the fact that the wedding cards and invites said Henry and Charlotte while it was Claire and Henry who seemed to be getting married.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The only good thing about the wedding was the endless supply of wine, Claire decided. She was on her fifth glass already and her new husband seemed content to brood and let her drink. If he was displeased about her drinking, he certainly made no comment.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Henry Laurent. He seemed like a good guy, from what everyone was saying a perfect guy even. He was running his father's multimillion dollar company and he seemed good at what he did. He went to Harvard Business school, like her sister did except for the fact that he was much older. Claire wasn't used to men like him, she had always been attracted to the bad boys, the rugged boys, even though it always cost her in the end.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Her parents and sister have tried to set her up with boys like Henry for ages and she couldn't really find the appeal.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Well, look at me now, finally married to one. She thought as she shook her head wearily. She signaled for another glass of wine and Henry slowly leaned towards her.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>She caught a whiff of his clearly expensive and intoxicating cologne. Oh he definitely smelled as good as he looked! She thought to herself.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"I think you should lay off the wine, you've had enough."</p><p></p><p>Claire glared at him, who was he to tell her what to do?</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me what to do. You look like you need more wine yourself."</p><p></p><p>She said.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Henry sighed and looked away, he was not looking for an argument, at least not yet.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>The waiter approached them and Claire collected two glasses of wine, passing one to Henry who reluctantly took it and dropped it on the table.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"I don't know about you but I'm going to need more booze to get through this wedding."</p><p></p><p>She commented and Henry didn't reply her.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>It was time for the couple's dance. A waltz.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Claire was terrible at classical dancing, and her sister had picked a very cheesy song for their first dance.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>A Thousand Years by Christina Perri. How utterly romantic and completely ironic, considering the fact that her sister didn't even love him enough to make it to their own wedding.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how to dance... I mean I know.."</p><p></p><p>"But it's all fuzzy in my brain."</p><p></p><p>Claire confessed honestly.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Henry made no comments as he took her hand in his and led them to the dance floor.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"Follow my lead."</p><p></p><p>He whispered gently in her ear as he put his hand on her waist gently. Everyone in the hall had gone quiet as the lights of the hall dimmed and focused on the two of them.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Claire gulped hard, so many eyes looking at her, she never knew it would make her feel so queasy.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"Eyes on me."</p><p></p><p>Henry said gently as he raised her chin slightly and she looked into his yes. He was quite handsome, very handsome in fact. He smiled at her, as if reassuring her that she was going to be fine and it somehow eased her worries.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>She was going to be fine as long as she followed his lead and looked at him only.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>It felt like she had spent ages in Henry's arms, twisting, turning, dipping, he knew everything and he led her so gently, so delicately. Soon, she forgot all her fears and just danced with him, she forgot the thousand of eyes that were looking at her and it felt like it was a ballroom with only the two of them in it.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>That feeling ended rather quickly, as soon as the applause started to roll out, she was jolted out of her feelings and reminded of the present.</p><p></p><p>Henry had quickly masked his features, he wasn't smiling anymore and all of a sudden Claire felt very silly.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>It was over.</p><p></p><p>Then came the father daughter dance which reminded her of when she was younger and Charlotte and her would take turns dancing with her father. Those were fun times.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"I got you a surprise."</p><p></p><p>He said while they danced. Claire raised her eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>'Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Mum did mention something about a surprise."</p><p></p><p>Her Dad nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Consider it a token of my appreciation, after all that you've done. I know this hasn't been easy for you."</p><p></p><p>He sounded sincere, he sounded honest at least. Claire understood, it wasn't an easy decision for them to make, going on with the wedding, even after her sister's betrayal.</p><p></p><p>"It's waiting for you when you come back from your honeymoon. Your other surprise is sitting in your bank account."</p><p></p><p>Claire's eyes widened.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"You really went all out..."</p><p></p><p>He father shrugged.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"Only the best for my daughter."</p><p></p><p>Claire smiled.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Fair enough, she'd accept their gifts.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Slowly, the reception came to an end and the guests were expected to see Henry and Claire off. There was a private jet already waiting for them as they were to leave for their honeymoon in Bora Bora.&nbsp;<p></p><p></p><p>Her mother was next to her ready to hug her when it was time to go.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"I love you Claire, thank you for everything."</p><p></p><p>Claire nodded.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"I love you too Mum. I'm still mad at you all for making me do this..."</p><p></p><p>"A honeymoon mum? Do I really have to go?"</p><p></p><p>She asked and her mother shrugged as she looked at the Laurents who were hugging their son. They had been cordial throughout the entire wedding, with Claire's parents and with Claire too. They seemed to still hold a grudge against her family.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"You have to. You know it'll make everything even more believable."</p><p></p></div>

Chapter 6

<div data-v-5fc3cba6="" class="read-content fontSize20" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px;"><p dir="ltr">Claire spent more than half of the flight sleeping off all the acohol that she had during the wedding reception, While Henry worked on his laptop during the better part of the trip. It was strange, how different they both were and how they seemed to just fall into two separate routines.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">When they arrived at Bora Bora, Henry had gently woken Claire up as they got ready to land. She looked out the window and gasped. Claire, being a travel blogger had surprisingly not been to Bora Bora before, she had thought it overhyped at one point but then looking out the window, she could understand why people were willing to spend a large chunk of their life-savings just to make a trip to Bora Bora. It was really like a little piece of heaven on Earth ‚Äì she didn't know how else to describe it.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Henry seemed to be just as mesmerized but more quiet about it as they both looked out the window.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">They had barely said anything of note to each other during the trip and ever as they arrived in Bora Bora, they didn't say anything to each other.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Henry could sense the excitement on Claire's face as the plane descended through the clouds. As they broke free of the last cloud, a magnificent vista awaited them: a massive multi-coloured lagoon bordered by lush green atolls, the fringes of which broke the waves from the open ocean, and a mountainous island in the middle crowned by steep lofty peaks.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">What a sight!! Claire thought.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The airstrip was on one of the atolls, which meant that they had to take a boat to where they were heading. They were met at the arrivals hall with more garlands and ushered to a waiting boat.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Their luggage was taken care of, Claire's luggage had been packed last minute. Two of her cousins had assisted in buying some new clothing and beachwear for her and packed it up while the reception was ongoing.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">They were whisked away into the lagoon to the resort, the Sofitel Bora Bora Private Island. The boat ride to the resort was nothing short of stunning. The colours of the lagoon and the shape of Mt. Otemanu kept changing as they sped along.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Awesome. Claire thought.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">They were greeted at the resorts pier by the lovely Rebecca and a guitarist who also doubled as the resorts bouncer and were served ice cold Tahitian beer. Henry promptly refused his but Claire didn't hesitate to start drinking hers.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"It's lovely." She said and Henry nodded.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">She sighed as she rolled her eys, did he plan on ignoring her throughout the rest of the trip?</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">She thought as she got a good look at him. He was wearing a beach shirt and cargo shorts, the sun seemed to hit his face and hair in a way that made him look golden.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"'I know we don't like each other that much but we can at least try to be cordial throughout this entire trip."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Henry paused and then nodded.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"You're right. I'm sorry if I seem to be a little distant. I have a lot on my mind."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire nodded, she had seen him working on the plane. It could have been work related stress.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Is it work?"</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">She asked and he nodded.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"That...amongst other things yes."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Claire shrugged as she put on her sunshades.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"We're in Bora Bora now. It's a vacation, you should take some well deserved time off, honeymoon or not."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Bora Bora was quite beautiful. Claire couldn't quite put her foot on why exactly it was, maybe it was the mix of the lagoons breathtaking shades of turquoise, aquamarine, sapphire, emerald, fluorescent green and electric blue ‚Äì she could spend a day or two there just trying to get her mind around the myriad of colours; the impressive rock face of Mt. Otemanu that towered over the whole lagoon; the crystal clear water and pristine white sandy beaches; the low-rise resorts that gave the place a very exclusive feel with their idyllic thatched roof overwater bungalows; the constant scent of frangipani and tiare Tahiti the national flower that was used for almost everything; and the fact that they were in the middle of the South Pacific!</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">While Claire admired the resort, Henry sorted out their reservations.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He came back later a few minutes later.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"I took the liberty of getting us separate bungalows, I know you'd very much like your own space."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He said as he handed her her keys and a tour pamphlet. It contained a list of activities that they would be doing daily.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"I'm still next to you in case you need anything."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">He said and Claire nodded. She didn't mind if they spent the whole vacation apart, in fact she was very much content with exploring the whole island on her hand and documenting it for her blog. The freedom of it all, she loved the sound of it.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">She smiled at Henry.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">"Thank you."</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">The little bungalow had a large bedroom and bathroom; a living room with a coffee table which featured a glass floor, making it possible to see the fish in the clear water below; and two decks, an upper deck in the shade and a lower deck with deck chairs and steps which led down to the water, Claire could imagine going snorkeling right off the deck and an outdoor shower.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">As excited as she was to explore she was also really tired and would very much like to rest. She picked up her phone and scrolled through her notifications, more than half of them were filled with congratulations, from friends who didn't know she was getting married, to her socials buzzing with excitement at the news with a lot of peple being confused as to why Charlotte wasn't the one who got married. She didn't care, her parents had a publicist for all that who would clean up whatever mess that Charlotte had made, it wasn't her problem to worry about.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Her father on the other hand had gifted her&nbsp; one of his property for her business, something that she had been requesting for months and he had also sent a fat check into her account that had her grinning from ear to ear.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">After about an hour of scrolling through social media, Claire settled in her bed to sleep and fell asleep.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Henry had been working to distract himself. The events of the last two days had been deeply troubling. He had been in his room, getting prepared for the wedding when his mother had broke the news to him. He had laughed it off and called Charlotte, she didn't pick up. He had sent her a text the night before their wedding.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">It had read.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr"><em>I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. I know you think we're moving too fast but the past few weeks with you have been amazing. I love you Charlotte.</em></p><p></p><p dir="ltr">That was the very first time he told her that he loved her and he regretted it deeply, more than anything in the world. He had been staring outside the window, wondering where it had all gone wrong, trying her number every second that passed till his father came to announce to him that the wedding was still on.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">How? Why?</p><p></p><p dir="ltr">Charotte was missing! He had screamed.

Chapter 7

<div data-v-5fc3cba6="" class="read-content fontSize20" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px;"><p>The next morning, Henry was awake sooner than he had expected, he had not been able to get a good night's sleep even though his bed was as comfortable as it could be.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>He walked out of his thatched roof bungalow and immediately saw Claire in the water, she was taking a dive in the clear water. She looked happy and peaceful. It was early, the water must be cold, he thought as he went back in his bungalow to get her a robe.<p></p><p></p><p>He always knew that Charlotte had a sister but Charlotte rarely mentioned her. In the words of Charlotte, 'Claire's rarely ever home and we're not close.'</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Charlotte claimed they had a difficult relationship, and had mentioned that she wasn't even sure she was comig to the wedding despite her parents extending an invite to her.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>When she had walked into the church, Henry had seen her, for the very first time. And while he could see that they looked very similar, Claire was different. Her features were sharper. Her skin was tan from all the sun she must have gotten on her trip.. Her grey eyes were brighter, sticking out of her eyes like mini glaciers, she had high cheekbones and a sharp mouth. She was stunning, she posessed none of the delicateness and charm that her sister had, instead, what she had was her witty mouth and sharp edge. Henry didn't know how he was ever going to cope with someone like her.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>He also knew that she rarely settled down home for more than six months, Claire unlike her sister had studied History in Yale, then went to get her Master of Fine Arts at Yale school of art. Unlike her sister, she had chosen to gallivant around the world travelling instead of settling down somewhere after school.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>He came back out with the robe and Claire was already getting out of the water. She saw him and she smiled at him.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"You're up early."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She noted as she hoisted herself up and sat on the deck, Henry gave her the robe and looked away quickly. she had gone out swimming in a purple bikini.<p></p>Claire rolled her eyes as she saw him looking away.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"You can look now."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"I couldn't sleep."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>He said and Claire nodded.<p></p>"Me too."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She replied as she wrapped the robe around herself.<p></p>"I'm going snorkeling later today after breakfast, do you want to come?"<p></p>She asked and Henry shook his head.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"I'm not sure... I'll think about it."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Claire nodded. She was just being nice, but he seemed to not care.<p></p>"Okay, I'll see you at breakfast then."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Henry didn't come for breakfast, Claire didn't mind, she helped herself to the platter of food and made friends with the locals and other people that were vacationing at the resort, she even managed to take some good pictures for her blog.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Soon, it was time for them to go snorkeling and Claire attached herself to a group and grabbed her snorkelling gear and swam around the reefs for several hours. The corals weren't as spectacular as the ones she saw in Malaysia and Australia but there were large numbers of multi-coloured fish such as the emperor angelfin, triggerfish and parrotfish. She had a lot of fun snorkeling. After spending hours in the water, she came back to the deck and found out that Henry was still somehow holed up in his room, she sighed and looked away.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>It wasn't her problem.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She spent the afternoon on the deck, enjoying the view, listening to her iPod and looking out for black-tipped reef sharks; She saw quite a few of them as they leisurely swam by their deck just before sunset.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She watched the sunset and it looked heavenly, truly beautiful, she thought as she stared at it, Henry came out to sit next to her while she watched the sunset.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"It's beautiful."<p></p>He said and Claire nodded.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"I know. Been sitting here and watching it. It's honestly one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen."<p></p>Henry nodded.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"And I'm sure you've seen your fair share of sunsets, travelling the world and all."<p></p>Claire nodded.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"I have."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Did Charlotte tell you that I travelled the world?"<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Henry nodded after a brief silence.<p></p>"Why did you travel the world?"<p></p>He finally asked and Claire shrugged.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"I don't know. I've always wanted to."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Henry nodded.<p></p>"I don't think that's the real reason. I was engaged to your sister for eight months, it was a fairly long engagement and I didn't see you once."<p></p><p></p><p>Claire nodded.</p><p></p>He was right, that bit was true. It wouldn't kill her to tell the truth for once, even if he didn't care about her.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Anytime I go home, my parents never cease to remind me of who I am, who I'm supposed to be, what I'm supposed to be doing and all that. Staying away from home was the best way to avoid them and do what I love at the same time."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Oh."<p></p>"That must have been hard."<p></p>He replied and Claire nodded.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Even harder with a sister like Charlotte."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Were you two close?"<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Claire chuckled.<p></p>"We stopped being close a long long time ago."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"What happened?"<p></p>He asked and Claire shrugged. She didn't want to give any more details, she knew he was only being polite.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"We grew up."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Her phone started ringing and she picked it up.<p></p>It was a strange number from a strange location.<p></p>"Excuse me. Give me a sec."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Sure."<p></p>Henry said as he made a move to leave.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Claire?"<p></p>The voice said after Claire picked up. Claire gasped.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Charlotte!"<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Henry stopped and turned to Claire, who looked every bit as shocked as she was.<p></p>"Claire! I am so sorry!"<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"I think it's way too late to be offering apologies now Char. Way too late."<p></p>Claire snapped.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"I know. I know. I thought they were going to call off the wedding since I left with Rhys, I thought..."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Well you thought wrong! You of all people know our parents, did you really think they would have called it off? "<p></p>"Was this your plan all along? To have me roped in and take your place?"<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Charlotte sighed on the phone."I swear to God Claire, I didn't even know you were coming for the wedding, you didn't say you were.."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Claire shrugged.<p></p>"I had to. Mum and Dad threatened to cut me off after I missed the first flight they told me to take a week ago."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"I came home and you were missing and they told me to take your place. You know what would have happened if I said no."<p></p>"At least you were prepared to run. I wasn't."<p></p><p></p><p>Claire said quietly.</p><p></p><p>Henry was watching her, listening to their conversation and assessing her.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>He had been stupid to think Claire had willingly obliged to be her sister's replacement.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She had not.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She had just been as unwilling as he was.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Can I speak to her? Please."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Henry said with urgency laced in his tone.<p></p>Claire gave him the phone, barely listening to the spew of excuses and apologies her sister was spewing.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"Hello Charlotte."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Henry said with quiet rage.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Charlotte went mute on the other line.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"He.. Henry?"<p></p></div>

Chapter 8

<div data-v-5fc3cba6="" class="read-content fontSize20" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px;"><p>"Henry..."</p><p></p>Charlotte said and Henry nodded. One could see the pain that was in his eyes, it was hard to miss.<p></p>"I called you so many times, left several messages, the least you could have done was given me an explanation."<p></p>"I am so sorry?"<p></p>Henry chuckled.<p></p>"See, that's the thing. I don't know what you're sorry for, for getting caught or for jilting me and leaving me at the altar."<p></p>"You could have said no, I would have been rational about it, I would have understood. You didn't."<p></p>"You just kept stringing me along while you had your devious plan in mind."<p></p>"I'm so sorry Henry, I didn't mean for it to happen this way..."<p></p>Claire watched uncomfortably, the way he talked, the strain on his face, he had loved her sister.<p></p>Or still loves her by the looks of it. Was that why he was cold to her?<p></p>Distant?<p></p>Seeing her must have reminded him too much of Charlotte.<p></p>Claire walked away, the conversation was too hard for her to listen, she was going to give them their privacy.<p></p>About a minute or two later, Henry walked up to her and gave her back her phone.<p></p>"Thank you."<p></p>He said and Claire nodded.<p></p>He was about to leave, Claire gently pulled his arm.<p></p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry that she hurt you. Now, I understand why you were so cold to me, it must have hurt seeing my face and then thinking about her."</p><p></p>Henry nodded.<p></p>"You're right. I kept convincing myself that the two of you were different. You are, but the similarities are still there and I can't shake that away easily."<p></p>Claire nodded.<p></p>"Take as much time as you need, healing from a heartbreak isn't that easy."<p></p>He chuckled.<p></p>"That's the thing, I don't think I'm heartbroken, just very disappointed."<p></p>"Your sister and I were in an arranged marriage, yes. But a few months into our engagemet we decided to get to know each other, we told ourselves having a long engagement will give us enough time to get to know each other. We both agreed to it."<p></p>"The last few weeks we spent together, I could already envision my life with her in it, I was excited for once in my life. She was perfect, she was everything I ever wanted and she was going to be mine. I had committed myself into making what we had worked and I thought she was committed too."<p></p>"Imagine the shock I felt when they told me she had left."<p></p>Claire sighed, Charlotte had done way worse than she expected her to.<p></p>"I am truly sorry Henry. You seem like a genuinely good guy, I don't know why my sister never told you about how she truly felt. Maybe she didn't want to hurt you?"<p></p>Henry started laughing.<p></p>"Hurt me? Comapred to this?"<p></p>"Is public humiliation and being jilted much better than her telling me earlier?"<p></p>"Because I can guarantee you she didn't know that you would take her place. She thought the wedding would be called off."<p></p>Well, that was true. It was all true, Claire thought as she shook her head.<p></p>If there was one thing Charlotte had not done, she had not really cared about how many people would be affected by her decision. If it wasn't for Claire, everything would be in complete jeopardy right.<p></p>She thought as she shook her head.<p></p>"I'm sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable these last few days. None of this is your fault."<p></p>"In fact, I should be thanking you for not letting your sister plunging me into humiliation and saving our families."<p></p>He said and Claire smiled.<p></p>"You're welcome. You've turned out not to be the complete pain in the ass like I envisioned. That's a point for you!"<p></p>Henry nodded.<p></p>"And you, you look like you're cooler than your sister, that's one more point for you."<p></p>"I am. Everyone knows that I'm the fun sister."<p></p>She whispered.<p></p>They chuckled as they looked at the water, it looked wonderful in the moonlight.<p></p>Claire turned to him.<p></p>"Want to go for a dip?"<p></p>She asked as she took off her shorts and her shirt. She had her bikini underneath.<p></p>Henry managed to keep his eyes focused on her eyes, trying hard not to look at her body.<p></p>She grinned as she caught him trying so hard and plunged into the water.<p></p>She came back up a few seconds later.<p></p>"Oh My God! Come on in Henry! It feels so gooood."<p></p>She drawled.<p></p>He was about to say no, in fact he was going to say no but decided against it. One dip wouldn't hurt.<p></p>"Okay."<p></p>In one swift motion he took off his beach shirt and Claire's mouth went dry as she watched him. He was ripped! How didn't she ever notice that part of him?<p></p>His body was something straight out of a GQ Men's magazine. Henry cleared his throat as he caught her staring and Claire's cheeks reddened.<p></p>"I didn't know you were so ripped. You hide it so well."<p></p>She said and he raised his eyebrows.<p></p>"Hitting the gym is one of my favorite pastimes."<p></p>"Weird. I thought it'd be something as mundane as golf or watching the stock market."<p></p>Henry nodded.<p></p>"Those too. I'm a man of many talents."<p></p>"I can see that."<p></p>Claire said as he slowly dropped into the water.<p></p>He smiled. He had a beautiful smile, the kind of smile that could melt hearts while also equally making one smile.<p></p>Claire never thought she'd start to feel so attracted to Henry. It was barely a few days in their sham of a marriage. Get yourself together woman! She cautioned herself as she took a dive into the water and swam closer to the deck, putting some distance between the both of them.<p></p>"Tommorrow we're going shark feeding. Wanna come?"<p></p>She asked him and Hnery nodded.<p></p>"Yes. That sounds interesting."<p></p>"I'd love to tag along."<p></p>He added and Claire nodded.<p></p>"That's good. Because you need to at least be having some real fun before we leave here."<p></p><p></p><p>The following day, Claire and Henry went for an island tour which included shark and manta ray feeding. They first visited the edge of the lagoon, a shallow area near one of the wave-breaking atolls. In the distance, huge waves from the open ocean pounded on the atoll while we calmly bobbed up and down in the relative calm of the lagoon.</p><p></p>"Scared?"<p></p>Henry asked as they watched the ocean.<p></p>"No. More like excited."<p></p>Claire corrected.<p></p>One of the two guides jumped into the water with a bucket full of fish. They jumped in along with him and within minutes, they were surrounded by a school of black-tipped reef sharks, some up to two meters long. They swam around them for a bit, checking them out, then ventured closer. Claire was quite surprised when one of them swam up to within two meters of her.<p></p>"I think that one likes you."<p></p>Henry said and Claire nodded as she grinned ear to ear.<p></p>"Looks like he does."<p></p>The shark then made a quick turn.<p></p>"Awwn, it's leaving."<p></p>Claire discovered why it left when one of the guides hauled her back into the boat: she had cut her foot on the sharp coral and though it was only a small cut, the little blood that emanated from the wound was more than sufficient to make a shark gauge if she was suitable for lunch.<p></p>"Oh God! Sorry about that."<p></p>Henry said as he accessed the cut on her foot.<p></p>"Does it hurt?"<p></p>He asked as he touched her foot delicately.<p></p>"It's not that bad... It's not deep."<p></p>They then circumnavigated the island and judging by the silence, everyone on the boat was just absolutely mesmerised by the astounding scenery. Their last stop was near their resort in a shallow spot. As the boat anchored, about a dozen stingrays glided by beneath them. It was a stunning sight! They were soon in the water swimming around the gentle, inquisitive creatures.<p></p>They swam up to Claire and Henry several times and hovered around for a bit, long enough to allow Claire to run her hands across their backs. The largest rays had wingspans of more than two meters with tails of about the same length.<p></p>After they had checked out the island, they headed back to the resort where there was going to be a sort of mini party. Claire was getting ready for the party when Henry knocked on her door.<p></p>"Come in."<p></p>She said as she continued shuffling through her clothes to find something to wear.<p></p>"Getting ready for the party?"<p></p>He asked and Claire nodded.<p></p>"Are you coming?"<p></p>He nodded.<p></p>"Yes. I want to talk to you before the party."<p></p>"About what?"<p></p>"About us."<p></p></div>

Chapter 9

<div data-v-5fc3cba6="" class="read-content fontSize20" style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px;"><p>"Us?"</p><p></p>"I don't understand."<p></p>Claire said as she turned to him and he nodded.<p></p>"I know. I know, but we need to talk about us."<p></p>"You know the kind of situation we're in. And we both know that we aren't willing particpants to this marriage."<p></p>Claire nodded.<p></p>"It was either I get married or go broke. I didn't have much of a choice."<p></p>Henry chuckled and then nodded.<p></p>"We can still live happily together, even with nothing between us."<p></p>Claire raised her eybrow, she liked the sound of whatever he was suggestuing,<p></p>But was was he even suggesting?<p></p>"I am going to need you to elaborate further for me Henry."<p></p>Henry nodded.<p></p>"I'm just saying, we should make things a little but easier for ourselves. We don't have to force feelings or anything. We can live separate lives while staying married."<p></p>"Discretely of course."<p></p>He added and Claire nodded.<p></p>Hnery gulped hard, it was hard to gauge Claire's reaction when she was giving him such a stern glare. He really could not tell what the woman was thinking.<p></p>"Are you suggesting we take partners?"<p></p>She said slowly, sensually even.<p></p>Henry chuckled nervously.<p></p>"I just want us both to be happy and if we're going to be happy with other people, we both have the freedom to do it. But it has to be discrete."<p></p>"No one else except the two of us must know of this. To the world, we must appar to be a perfect and loving couple."<p></p>He added and Claire sat down slowly on her bed.<p></p>A ruse. An elaborate ruse for them to both pretend that they were happy and in love while doing the complete opposite behind doors.<p></p>"You want us to pretend? To fake some sort of marital bliss?"<p></p>She asked and Henry nodded.<p></p>He sat next to her and held her hand, worried she might take it all the wrong way.<p></p>"That's the only way we can get through this without drawing unnecessary attention on ourselves and family. We're already married, we might as well fake the part."<p></p>"That will take a lot of work and effort Henry, putting up an act for so long..."<p></p>Henry nodded.<p></p>"It's hard, I know. But it'll be much easier since we both understand why we have to do it and agree to do it. We'll just have to keep up with public appearances and then we can do whatever we want behind closed doors."<p></p>Claire nodded.<p></p>"Alright. I agree, it's the best way for us right now. But, I still want a divorce offer on the table."<p></p>Claire said and Henry nodded.<p></p>"Done! But it'll have to be well after a few years. At least about three to five years after the wedding."<p></p>Claire cocked her head and then nodded.<p></p>"I think I can work with that."<p></p>"And we're allowed to take partners?"<p></p>Henry nodded.<p></p>"As many as we want. I think it's also proper if we notify each other when we're seeing someone, so we can look out for one another."<p></p>Claire nodded.<p></p>"That is a great idea, I have such bad taste in men. Maybe you can introduce me to some men you know who I'd willingly and quickly have an affair with."<p></p>Henry grinned.<p></p>"That shouldn't be too hard. I know a few of my acquaintances that'll be ready and willimg."<p></p>Claire grinned as she hooked her arm with Henry.<p></p>"Fantastic! You'll have to introduce me to them someday."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>An hour later, Claire emerged from her bungalow wearing a red strapless dress that she had picked out. It was one of the new additions to her wardrobe that her cousins had gotten for her while shopping for her honeymoon and she loved it. The straps were two strings that connected at the back of the dress which was mostly backless, the dress had a plunging neckline, fitted bodice and a flowing skirt that was suitable for the mini party they would be having at the resort.<p></p>She had tousled her hair a little while contemplating on putting it in a high ponytail otr not, eventually, she put it in a messy high bun and picked dangling earrings amd a couple of bracelets to go with them.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Henry was the first person who spotted her as she approached. She looked beautiful, he thought as he looked at her from head to toe. One thing that he was certain was a difference between Charlotte and Claire was tgeir bodies. Charlotte had been leaner, her sister Claire had a fuller and shapely body. She stopped to greet some of the locals and chatted animatedly with them. They had barely spent a week in the resort and everyone already knew her. She had a way with people that he didn't believe anyone else had.<p></p>"Is that your wife? I saw you two at the deck this morning."<p></p>A man said as he stood next to Henry while watching Claire.<p></p>"Yes."<p></p>Henry said and glared at the man. He was gawking at Claire, in a way that made Henry feel unbelievably uncomfortable. The potbellied red faced man took a sip out of his beer and he nodded.<p></p>"That's one hell of a wife you got there!"<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Claire turned towards him at a point and she smiled. She waved at him with enthusiasm.<p></p>Henry waved back, eager for her to come join him at the party next to him so that the man who was ogling her would at least have the decency to stop.<p></p>"Can you believe we leave tomorrow? I love this place!"<p></p>Claire said as she was handed a cold Tahitian beer while she sat next to Henry. Henry could believe it, Charlotte herself had opted for a short honeymoon, claiming thy couldn't be away from work for so long.<p></p>Henry had agreed, not only because she had said so, but because he was also going to be incredibly busy with work around the time.<p></p>"You can stay longer if you like. I'll go back to San Diego and set everything up."<p></p>He suggested and Claire shook her head.<p></p>"As much as I'd love to, I also have work to do."<p></p>"I have a new project that I'm very excited to start."<p></p>Henry raised his eyebrows. She had piqued his interest.<p></p>"What is it?"<p></p>There was a glimmer in Claire's eye as they dicussed about the project.<p></p>"Oh I can't say too much for now. But it's sort of a wellness centre slash reacreation spot. I'll tell you all about it when we're back in San Diego."<p></p>"I'm looking forward to it."<p></p>He replied.<p></p>They were both caught up in each other's eyes till they were jolted out of their reverie when the DJ increased the music.<p></p>"Care to dance?"<p></p>Henry asked her as he took her hand gently in his, her hands were so small compared to his.<p></p>Claire looked like she was going to say no but Henry dragged her up.<p></p>"Don't worry, you can dance freely this time,"<p></p>"I'll even follow your lead."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>He whispered slowly in her ear. His words tickled her ear and she giggled slightly while they both made their way to the dance floor.<p></p>The music started out slow, sensous, they circled each other, their gaze remained locked. Henry placed his hand on her back, her hand on his shoulder, and their free hands finally met. Together, they danced to the music, their feet in perfect sync.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>As the song progressed, the beat got faster, Claire felt more relaxed, and allowed a small smile to form on her lips while staring at the baby blue eyes of Henry. He was great at dancing. His body seemed to move with the rhythm of the music effortlessly, he made it look flawless.<p></p>Claire watched him quietly, she liked watching him. There was always something new she discovered about him while watching him.<p></p>He turned elegantly, his body in tune with the music. Yet, there was a sort of harshness to him, like he was someone who shouldn't be underestimated. Claire didn't quite care at the moment. She was in Bora Bora! She was enjoying herself!<p></p>But she couldn't deny that something seemed to be happening between them, the warmth between them grew more powerful by the second. Her heartbeat was growing steadily along with it.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>She looked away suddenly, breaking eye contact with him.<p></p>This cannot happen.<p></p>She told herself.<p></p>I cannot fall in love with him!<p></p></div>
