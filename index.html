            <h2>Chapter 1: Divorce

            </h2>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c1">A message alert sounded.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ding!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[Please go to the hospital to donate blood as soon as possible.]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Nicole saw this message, she was stunned for a moment like she had sustained a blow to her chest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The sender&#39;s name was &#39;Hubby&#39;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ding!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Another message immediately followed. It was a notice from the bank that she had received a fund transfer of 500,000 dollars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicole scrolled up to look at her message history with her husband.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[Remember to go to the hospital.]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[Fund Transfer: 500,000]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[Remember to come to the hospital to donate blood.]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[Fund Transfer: 500,000]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[Please come to the hospital right away.]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In their three years of marriage, the time Nicole&#39;s husband, Eric Ferguson, initiated contact with her was to ask her to go to the hospital to donate blood. To be exact, to donate blood to Wendy Quade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicole&#39;s blood type was a rare negative blood type. Eric also treated Nicole as a stranger throughout their marriage, which was more than just cold.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This month alone, Nicole had already given blood three times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicole sat on the sofa. Her eyes gradually became moist and started to rain. Yesterday, while she was waiting for Eric to get off work, she stood in the rain for more than an hour, so she was feeling unwell today and dizzy but did not go to the office. Eric probably did not know that she had a fever either.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She coughed and held her phone, hesitating whether to reply. Suddenly, an unfamiliar number sent a message: [Has Eric ever looked at you once with love and respect in his eyes, even for a moment in three years? You&#39;re just a nominal Mrs. Ferguson. He shamelessly occupied the position of Mrs. Ferguson that you crashed into last night and slept at my place last night. If I were you, I&#39;d find a rope to hang myself. You&#39;re just an interfering homewrecker!]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicole suddenly felt suffocated, depressed, and was shaken. Nicole was Eric Ferguson&#39;s legal wife. She gave up her family and friends to marry this man for three years, yet she was labeled a despicable homewrecker?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Once again, her chest felt like it was crushed. All those accumulated feelings for Eric throughout her humble days as his wife suddenly shattered into pieces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Following that message, a photo was sent to her phone. It was Eric&rsquo;s calm sleeping face. His handsome sculpted features were like an intricate art piece that made her so attracted to him, like a moth to a flame. This picture was an attestation to the message earlier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The woman nestled on Eric&rsquo;s shoulder was none other than Wendy Quade. Although both of them have their eyes closed, the curled-up corners of Wendy&#39;s lips showed her wakefulness at that moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">They looked like a pair of intimate lovers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her phone suddenly rang. It was a call from the Ferguson Villa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When Nicole habitually picked it up, Eric&#39;s mother, Quinn, curtly ordered her around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&#39;Nicole, did you forget what day it is? The maids are off today, so hurry up and come over to cook for us!&#39;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicole sneered and hung up the phone without saying anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She had been walking on eggshells around Eric Ferguson, trying to maintain this fragile marriage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At the office, everyone underestimated her, but she still did her best to play the role of Eric&rsquo;s secretary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At home, Eric&rsquo;s mother and sister looked down on her because of her &#39;unknown origins&#39;. They were mean and picked on her every chance they could. They ordered her around, asking her to cook, do the laundry, and even clean the house. Nicole, who was supposed to be the Young Madam of the Ferguson family, was treated like a lowly servant. She stayed meek and obedient. She also never complained about any of this to Eric for fear of troubling him and putting him in a difficult position.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She had endured so much that she was desensitized to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Regardless of how much others despised her, Nicole was still willing to persist and endure all of it for the sake of Eric Ferguson.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">However, for the past three years, Eric never seemed to remember that she was his wife. The extent of their communication was when he gave her work to do at the office, urged her to donate blood, and transferred money to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At this moment, Nicole felt exhausted. She could not hold on any longer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This was not the first time Wendy Quade tried to provoke her. In the past, Nicole could always laugh off those harsh and mean words, but this photo completely trampled on her self-esteem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Humiliation, loneliness, and a harsh cold engulfed her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Was my three years of marriage a joke?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">At this moment, Nicole&#39;s face was extremely glum. She had finally made up her mind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&#39;Fine. It&#39;s time for this joke to be over.&#39;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicole scrolled through her phone, and without hesitation, she sent Eric a message.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[Let&rsquo;s get a divorce.]</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Although she was still feeling dizzy, she knew that this was the right decision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Eric called her immediately. Nicole had already expected his wrath at this moment. The man&#39;s voice was harsh and cold as he said, &#39;Nicole, what are you making a fuss about? How much do you want? Just state a price. The doctor said that Wendy&#39;s in critical condition...&#39;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicole forcefully suppressed the dizziness and interrupted his words. She smiled coldly and said in a hoarse voice, &#39;Eric Ferguson, I&#39;ll see you at the City Hall in an hour, or you can watch her die.&#39;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She hung up after that sentence. Immediately after, she received another message.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">[Fund transfer: $1,000,000]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&#39;Hahahaha...&#39;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nicole laughed out loud as her tears gushed out uncontrollably.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&#39;This is absurd! It&rsquo;s just too ridiculous...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
